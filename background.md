# Background
The Australian housing market has faced increasing challenges between 2021 and 2030. Rising property prices, rental affordability issues, and fluctuating interest rates have created pressure on households, policymakers, and investors. 

A Business Analyst is required to study these factors, capture stakeholder needs, and propose a data-driven dashboard for monitoring and decision-making. This dashboard will provide insights into trends, risks, and opportunities in the real estate sector.
# Gather Background Information

Research the problem domain: rising housing prices, rental stress, affordability concerns across Australian states.

Review existing reports: ABS housing affordability, CoreLogic property price trends, state government housing supply/demand reports.

Check previous projects/tools: look at public dashboards (ABS, Domain, realestate.com.au) to see current gaps.
